# Hi, I'm Ryan Delaney

I am a Principal Engineer at [Revere CRE](https://reverecre.com). I work across
the stack on everything from product, backend, build pipelines and DevOps, to
design.

Previously I worked at Google on the internal JavaScript and TypeScript
toolchain. Some projects I worked on are the
[Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler),
[tsickle](https://github.com/angular/tsickle), and formerly
[clutz](https://github.com/angular/clutz). This toolchain supports everything at
Google from the largest apps like Search and Drive to small internal apps,
regardless of the framework used.

Some open-source projects I've worked are:

- [ReasonablyTyped](https://github.com/rrdelaney/ReasonablyTyped), for
  converting TypeScript type declarations to other languages, including
  ReasonML.
- [reason-scripts](https://github.com/rrdelaney/reason-scripts), a popular
  development environment for ReasonML.
- [bs-loader](https://github.com/rrdelaney/bs-loader), a popular webpack loader
  for ReasonML and OCaml.

I enjoy working on frontend tooling and how we can improve both end-user and
developer experience. If you'd like to reach out you can contact me at rrdelaney
