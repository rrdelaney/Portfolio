I purchased the Microsoft Surface Pro in January 2013. It is a great concept for a device;
small, functional, powerful, and best of all, adaptable. I think the fact that the Surface Pro
fills so many roles is one of the primary reasons I bought it. For two and a half years now
it has been my primary device for developing this website and other projects, professional IT work,
and Netflix. However, the device is starting to wear, and I'd like to document exactly what is going wrong.

For reference, I run Windows 10 on my SP.

### The Casing

My Surface has been through what I deem "normal" wear and tear. It lived in the backpack of a
college student for two years, and has suffered from two or three drops at a normal height.
There are no scratches on the screen, although the aluminum back has been scratched up quite a bit.

### The Battery

The battery life on my Surface Pro was never great. At best I got around 4 hours with massive CPU throttling,
enough so compiling this website took about 8 minutes. But as a college student at a technical school I was
never too far away from an outlet so I could always get though the day. Over time though, the battery life
started getting worse and worse. After the upgrade to Windows 10 though, it hit unbearable. I can get about
an hour out of it, with CPU throttling.

In the last week though, the Surface battery has tanked. It won't charge while on
if the battery is over 50%. In addition, whether the Surface will turn on is a very
hard question to answer.

All of these conditions make a system that is unsuitable for any software development.

### The Charger

Adding to the horrible experience with the battery, the charger actually failed!
About a year in to owning the Surface, the charger outright stopped working.
It would get hot, but not charge anything. After talking to Microsoft support
about this, they refused to replace the original charger, because my device was
out of warranty, which was expected. What wasn't expected was the _$80_ replacement
charger. This led to a string of bad 3rd party charger bought for cheap on Amazon.
