I purchased the Microsoft Surface Pro in January 2013. It is a great concept for a device;
small, functional, powerful, and best of all, adaptable. I think the fact that the Surface Pro
fills so many roles is one of the primary reasons I bought it. For two and a half years now
it has been my primary device for developing this website and other projects, professional IT work,
and Netflix. However, the device is starting to wear, and I'd like to document exactly what is going wrong.

For reference, I run Windows 10 on my SP.

### The Casing

My Surface has been through what I deem "normal" wear and tear. It lived in the backpack of a 
college student for two years, and has suffered from two or three drops at a normal height. 
There are no scratches on the screen, although the aluminium back has been scratched up quite a bit.

### The Battery

The battery life on my Surface Pro was never great. At best I got around 4 hours with massive CPU throttling, 
enough so compiling this website took about 8 minutes. But as a college student at a technical school I was 
never too far away from an outlet so I could always get though the day. Over time though, the battery life 
started getting worse and worse. After the upgrade to Windows 10 though, it hit unbearable. I can get about 
an hour out of it, with CPU throttling.
