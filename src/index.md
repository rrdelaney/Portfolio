# Hi, I'm Ryan Delaney!

I'm a developer working at Google on our internal JavaScript and TypeScript
toolchain. Some projects I work on are the [Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler),
[tsickle](https://github.com/angular/tsickle), and formerly [clutz](https://github.com/angular/clutz).
Our toolchain supports everything at Google from the largest apps like Search and Drive to small
internal apps, regardless of the framework used.

Some open-source projects I've worked are:

- [ReasonablyTyped](https://github.com/rrdelaney/ReasonablyTyped), for converting TypeScript type declarations to
  other languages, including ReasonML.
- [reason-scripts](https://github.com/rrdelaney/reason-scripts), a popular development environment for ReasonML.
- [bs-loader](https://github.com/rrdelaney/bs-loader), a popular webpack loader for ReasonML and OCaml.

I enjoy working on frontend tooling and how we can improve both end-user and developer experience.
