> My personal website

Uses:
* React
* Glamorous

## Developing

First install dependencies by running:

```
yarn install
```

and then start the app with:

```
yarn start
```

This will start the app with hot-reloading enabled.

The site is developed with the StandardJS styleguide.
Lint with:

```
yarn lint
```

## Building

There are two steps to creating a production build:
bundling the JS + CSS and minifying, and then prerendering
the site.

To build the JS, run:

```
yarn build
```

To prerender the site, run:

```
yarn prerender
```
